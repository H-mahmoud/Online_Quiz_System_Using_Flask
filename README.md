# Online Quiz System Using Flask

Knowledge is power. There are so many things in the world to learn, and quizzes help in testing the understanding of those concepts. 
Taking tests is one way to find out things you donâ€™t fully understand.
This is where the Quiz Application comes in. 
The Quiz Application will present questions to the users and expect the right answers to those questions.
With the Quiz Application, special users you can call Teachers will be allowed to create tests, so regular users can answer the questions and test their understanding of the topics in the quiz.
